The goal of this project is to make a Vaporwave inspired 
cacluator based on the requirements from The Odin Project. 

When completed, this webpage should be able to do the following:

* Add
* Subtract
* Multiply
* Divide
* Populate a display when entering/clicking number buttons
* User will be able to clear display
* User will be able to delete wrongly entered numbers.
* Have a 2nd "display" above current inputs showing previous operation
* Be able to string several operations together. eg ( 12 + 7 -5 * 3 ) = 42
    but do each operation seperately. It should evaluate the first
    expression, then use this result as the first number in the new
    calculation.
